			<h3>Startup</h3>
			<p>The website should work on any device, however we recommended using a modern browser and at first your desktop. Testing from mobile devices should also be possible.</p>
			
			<h3>Briefing</h3>
			<p>Hello, we’re designing a new marketplace interface for the Massachusetts Open Cloud, which will allow you to purchase, provision, and manage networking/computing clouds from a variety of providers within the MOC.</p> 
			<p><strong>Informed consent:</strong>  We are conducting a study to find out what people think about this. We will not record or publish any information with your name. This is for a course we’re taking in Human-Computer Interaction from Prof. Bickmore in the College of Computer and Information Science. Your participation is voluntary and you can stop anytime and ask that your data not be used. It should take about 20 minutes and we will compensate you with an M&M. Can you help us out with this?</p>
			<p>Thanks! As I said before, we’re part of a project building an open cloud in Massachusetts. Part of the project is a web site that servers as a marketplace for searching, selecting, purchasing, and managing servers for your cloud(s).  The purpose of today’s session is for you to help us determine how to make this web interface more user-friendly before we finish developing it. You might be surprised, but today we will not be using a computer. We’ve created a paper version of our interface and Will, a member of the MOC team, shall be playing the computer.</p> 
			<p>We’ve listed three main tasks that we anticipate users accomplishing with our interface, such as creating a virtual machine, getting connection information, and deleting a virtual machine. We’re asking for your help to tell us what makes sense, what is confusing, if things work the way you’d expect, and any other critiques you could provide.</p>
			<p>We’re not here today to test you in any way, but rather to ask for your help in testing our design. So any problems or confusion we run into today is not your fault, but a shortcoming of our design and something we’ll need to fix.</p>
			<p>The interface is still a work in progress, with some rough edges, as we’re still thinking through how it should work and some parts are not yet complete. Before setting things down in stone, we’d like to get some feedback about how well the interface’s design works.</p>
			<p>Please tell us what makes sense to you, anything that is confusing, and any questions that come to mind. Your questions are particularly valuable, but I may not answer them immediately, as our goal is the change the interface so it answers the questions or makes them unnecessary. </p>
			<p>Please remember, we’re testing the interface, and not you, any problems are the interface’s fault. </p>
			<p>Are you ready to begin? </p>
			
			<h3>Tasks</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Task 1 : Your task is to create a VM to perform <strong>MatLab</strong> computations. Username: moc \ Password: moc1234</p>
					<p>In this task users login and select the appliance they would like like to deploy. After a brief setup the VM is created and added to the users MyCloud page.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>Task 2 : Your task is to start your VM and obtain the <strong>IP Address</strong> you will later use to connect to the VM. Username: moc \ Password: moc1234</p>
					<p>In this task users pick up from where they left off in task one. Depending on their actions at the end of task one they either had to re-login then navigate to the VM or simply navigate to the MyCloud page to find the VM they just deployed. After they find the VM they must press the play button to turn the VM on.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>Task 3 : Your task is to <strong>delete</strong> your VM. Username: moc \ Passoword: moc1234</p>
					<p>In the final task users again start from where they left off in the previous task. They must find the delete option and select it to terminate the VM. They are prompted to confirm their action before the VM is removed from their MyCloud page.</p>
				</li>
